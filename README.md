# Hello there!
I’m Martina, a Computer Science student who wants to create some little personal projects (mainly in Java) when I'm not too busy studying for uni, so that I can improve my skills in programming.
I'm using GitHub as a motivational tool by publishing these projects as a sort of diary to show my progress.
